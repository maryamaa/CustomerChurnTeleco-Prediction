# **Predicting Customer Churn in Telecommunications**

## **Tools**
- Data Cleaning: Excel
- Dashboard: Power BI
- ML prediction: Azure ML

## **Project Motivation**
Overall, the motivation behind this project was to help a company address a critical business challenge while also showcasing the potential of data-driven solutions in improving business outcomes.

## **About Data**
The Telco Customer Churn dataset from kaggle is a collection of customer information compiled by IBM Sample Data Sets. The objective of this dataset is to predict customer behavior in order to retain them, which involves analyzing relevant customer data and developing customer retention programs.

## **Project Description**
In this project, we successfully predicted customer churn in a telecommunications company using customer data. We started by cleaning and analyzing the data using Excel, identifying patterns and trends in customer behavior and churn. We then created a dashboard using Power BI to provide visualizations and insights into customer behavior and churn patterns.

Next, we used ML Azure to build a machine learning model to predict which customers were most likely to churn. The model was trained on historical data and used various algorithms to determine the best approach for prediction. We fine-tuned the model by testing and evaluating its performance on a validation set, and achieved a high accuracy rate.
Finally, we used the model to identify customers who were at high risk of churning, allowing the telecommunications company to develop targeted retention programs to reduce customer churn. The project helped the company to retain more customers and increase their revenue.
Overall, this project demonstrated the power of data analysis, machine learning, and visualization tools in predicting customer churn and improving business outcomes in the telecommunications industry.
